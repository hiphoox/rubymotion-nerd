# Random Possessions Gold

This is the Gold challenge for exercise 02.

In it, we practice inheritance: a Container is an Item that can contain other Items (or Containers).

As container.rb depends on item.rb to compile, we specify this dependency on the Rakefile.

Thanks @colinta and @cirwin on the #RubyMotion channel!
